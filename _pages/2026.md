  <p><strong>Are we sure?</strong><p>
  <p>We increasingly rely on complex computations and simulations to support decision-making. But behind each answer lies a complex web of algorithmic approximations and data-driven parameters. So, how certain can we really be?</p>
  <p>At the 26th Geilo Winter School, we'll explore the foundations and frontiers of uncertainty quantification—starting from classical scientific computing and extending into the rapidly evolving field of scientific machine learning.</p>

## Program

### Fundamentals of Modern HPC Systems (Hicham Agueny)

In this lecture, we will cover the fundamentals of high-performance computing systems, from CPU and GPU architectures to high-speed interconnects and parallel file systems, including optimization strategies for GPU-aware data movement for performance and scalability.

### Uncertainty quantification in physical systems (Kjetil Olsen Lye)

This lecture series will introduce the motivation for and core concepts behind uncertainty quantification in physical systems. We will cover Monte Carlo methods and their variants, and explore alternative algorithms for computing uncertainty in specific settings. We will also use the uncertainty quantification framework to discuss the efficient construction and best-practice use of surrogate models. The presentation will be accompanied by small, self-contained coding exercises to help participants engage with and better understand the material.

### Monte Carlo methods and Polynomial Chaos Expansion for uncertainty propagation (David Métivier)

This series of lectures introduces sampling-based methods, focusing on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo techniques for numerical integration and uncertainty propagation. The second part presents Polynomial Chaos Expansion as an alternative approach. Hands-on exercises will reinforce the concepts through computational applications.

### Practical Bayesian inference using MCMC methods (Anne Reinarz)

This lecture series will focus on practical Bayesian inference using MCMC methods, including multilevel extensions, supported by hands-on use of UM-Bridge to run complex models efficiently.

### European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI) - from zero to science in minutes (Thomas Röblitz)

Thomas will demonstrate how EESSI allows you to go "from zero to science in minutes" on virtually any Linux system in the world. Beyond the introduction, he will be available to guide you through the hands-on sessions, helping you get your code running smoothly on the available HPC systems.
