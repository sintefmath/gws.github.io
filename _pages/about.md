The Geilo Winter School is an annual meeting place for PhD students, postdocs, and young researchers, organized by the [Department of Mathematics and Cybernetics](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/departments/department-of-mathematics-and-cybernetics/) at SINTEF Digital. Hosted at the historic Dr. Holms Hotel, the school brings together leading experts to teach cutting‑edge topics in computational science. Alongside the scientific program, each day includes a long mid‑day break—offering time for networking while enjoying the ski slopes and mountain surroundings of Geilo.

The school is organized by [Øystein Klemetsdal](https://klemetsdal.net/) and [Torkel Andreas Haufmann](https://www.sintef.no/alle-ansatte/ansatt/torkel.haufmann/) (SINTEF), with a scientific committee consisting of [Knut‑Andreas Lie](https://andreas.folk.ntnu.no/) (SINTEF/NTNU), [Signe Riemer‑Sørensen](https://www.sintef.no/alle-ansatte/ansatt/signe.riemer-sorensen/) (SINTEF), and [André R. Brodtkorb](https://brodtkorb.org/) (OsloMet).
