The Geilo Winter School is an annual meeting place for PhD students, Postdocs, and young researchers. Hosted at the historical Dr. Holms Hotel, the school gathers leading experts to lecture on emerging topics in computational sciences. In addition to scientific input, each day offers a break with ample time for networking while skiing in the mountains of Geilo.
